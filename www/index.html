									<h3>Concept</h3>
									<div class="inline_block">
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/angle_and_range.JPG" alt="" /></span>The goal of our project is to create a real time web API for relative <b>angle</b> and <b>range</b> information of a Tag from a measurement device.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="inline_block">
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/wall.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										To do this, we plan to use two fixed ultra wide band (UWB) radio transceivers (called <b>Anchor</b>s) to collect Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Flight (TOF) information of signals from a third, mobile UWB transceiver (called a <b>Tag</b>).

									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>
										Indoor position tracking applications are limitless -- from home automation, to security, or even finding your keys.
										Currently, indoor postion tracking systems are either too inaccurate for many of these applications, require extensive infrastructure, or are too expensive to achieve widespread adoption.
										<br><br>
										Our goal is to create an inexpensive plug-and-play device that precisely measures its range and angle from a Tag to support these types of applications.
									</p>

							<section id="compa">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
									<p>No current solutions exist that use UWB radios to measure range and angle to a device. Several systems exist that could be used for similar applications, though. For instance:</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="http://redpin.org/" class="image"><img src="images/redpin.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Wifi-based</h4>
												<p><a href="http://redpin.org/">Redpin</a> is an open source indoor positioning system that was developed with the goal of providing at least <b>room level accuracy</b>. This technology can be used on any wifi-connected device. Its utilization of current WiFi infrastructure makes it easy to adopt, but its accuracy rules it out for some applications.</p>

												<h4>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons</h4>
												<p><a href="http://estimote.com/">Estimote</a> is a company that creates small, wireless BLE radios that can be attached to any location or object in order to track surrounding smartphones. Estimote also has an SDK on top of which apps can be written in order to interact with their radios. Estimote boasts an average <b><a href="https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/201302836-How-precise-are-Estimote-Beacons-">measurement error of 20-30% of actual distance</a></b>. Estimote's SDK and battery operated beacons make installation easy, but because error grows with the distance from the beacons, high accuracy requires many beacons in the space.</p>

												<h4>Ultra Wide Band (UWB)</h4>
												<p>UWB radios use time of flight (TOF) analysis to gain distance readings with <b>sub-meter accuracy</b>. Because UWB radios are not yet ubiquitous (not in phones like BLE or WiFi), UWB tracking is often used in custom installations which are expensive. Additionally, the biggest player in the production of UWB transceivers, <a href="http://www.decawave.com/">Decawave</a>, is a closed source shop and charges large amounts to gain access to their <a href="http://www.decawave.com/products/trek1000" >development kits</a>.</p>

									<h3>Use Cases</h3>
									<div class="inline_block">
										<p>Because our final product is an API, our use cases can be thought of possible applications built on top of our API. Because our API is so general, there are many, many possible applications, so we will focus on one single example.</p>
										<h4>Indoor Localization Radar</h4>
										<p>We've all been there. Lost our phone somewhere in our house, but unable to find it (of course, it's placed on silent...sigh). Find my iPhone and other wifi-based localization apps will tell you your phone is in the building (great, you already knew that), but what you really want to know is where in the room it is.</p>
										<p>With our indoor localization radar app, all you have to do is place a small tag on your phone, and we will be able to tell you not only which room it is in, but where inside the room it is.</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/master/Docs/Images/Overall%20App%20Design.png" alt="" /></span>The app idea is to make an Android mobile application which can use data it receives from the server to show the most recent position of the tag being tagged. To do this the Android app will connect to the website and pull information and update the locations of the tags on screen. 
										<p>
										The main screen will have dots whcih move around representing different tags. </p>
									</p>
									<p>The dot representing the tag will move around as required. The position of the tag is fixed at the top of the screen and the user will have to orient himself that way as there is no way of knowing which direction the user is relative to the anchors.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="inline_block">
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/master/Docs/Images/New%20Tag%20Menu.png" alt="" /></span>
										It will allow the user to add new tags by entering their tag ID and a name for them.
										<p>This menu comes up when the user presses the plus button to add a new tag. The user can then enter a tag ID and the application will check to make sure it exists and if it does, add it to the main screen.</p>

									<h3>Architecture</h3>
									<div class="inline_block">
										<p>Below is a physical architectural diagram of our system including possible client applications. This diagram is meant to show the system structure and communication types. The blue boundary represents our system boundary. The purple boundary is meant to represent the physical and logical boundary of each Anchor/Tag. </p>
										<p>UWB communication is used to obtain the range data between each of the Anchors and the Tag using TOF analysis. Microcontrollers on each Tag/Anchor talk to the DWM1000 chip through SPI. Once each of the Anchors know their distance from the Tag, this information will be sent to the Raspberry Pi, along with the Tag ID. The Raspberry Pi will then compute the angle of arrival based on the two range estimates and the known distance between the Anchors. Once the angle of arrival is calculated, the range between the Tag and the midpoint of the Anchors will be calculated and these two pieces of data will be sent to the web server, with the Tag and measurement device IDs, through an internal API call. </p>

							<!-- Interaction Diagrams -->
							<section id="arch">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Interaction Diagrams</h3>
									<div class="inline_block">
										<h4>API-level Interaction</h4>
										<p>At a higher level, our project itself has very little user interaction (by design, for ease of use); the user simply needs to carry a Tag with them while in the presence of a measurement device to use the system itself. However, here is what we would expect user interaction with a client application to look like:</p>
										<img src="images/user_interaction.JPG" alt="">
									</div>

									<div class="inline_block">
										<h4>Internal Sysem Interaction</h4>
										<p>The goal of our system is to collect range and angle of arrival information about a single Tag, relative to a measurement device, over a period of time and create a web API from which applications can retrieve this information. </p>
										<p>The diagram shows the interaction between various components going through the process of collecting range and angle of arrival information for a single point in time.</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/RangeInteraction.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h5>Steps:</h5>
										<ol>
											<li><b>Poll</b> - Tag polls both Anchors in a broadcasted message.</li>
											<li><b>ResponseA</b> - Anchor A sends response to Tag.</li>
											<li><b>ResponseB</b> - Anchor B sends response to Tag.</li>
											<li><b>Final</b> - Tag broadcasts Final message to Anchors containing enough information for each Anchor to estimate range.</li>
											<li>Anchors tell Raspberry Pi their newly calculated range values. </li>
											<li>Raspberry Pi calculates angle of arrival and then makes API call to store new data on the Webserver. </li>
									</p>
									</div>


									<div class="inline_block">
										<h4>Ranging Protocol</h4>
										<p>At an even lower level, we need to define a ranging protocol across DWM1000s. </p>
										<p>For our protocol, we chose a variant of the Broadcast-Double-Sided Ranging (BDSR) protocol. This protocol has the Tag broadcast its messages, and lets all other devices respond in a staggered format.</p>
										<p>Below is a diagram showing the BDSR protocol with three anchors where Tprop is the propagation time between the Tag and the corresponding Anchor. </p>
									</div>

									<div class="inline_block">
										<img class="smallwidth" src="images/bdsr.JPG" alt="">
									</div>

									<div class="inline_block">
										<p>We chose to implement a variant of BDSR with only two Anchors.</p>
										<img src="images/RangeLargeText.png" alt="">
										<p>Message data sent throughout different steps of protocol:</p>

											<table class="alt">
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>Protocol Step</th>
														<th>Data Sent</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>Poll/td>
														<td>Range Session ID, Tag Address</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Response</td>
														<td>Range Session ID, Anchor ID</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Final</td>
														<td>Range Session ID, Tag Address, Tround1A, Treply2A, Treply1B, Treply2B</td>
													</tr>
												</tbody>
											</table>
										<p>One thing to note is that, at the end of our protocol, the information necessary to calculate propagation times is available on the Anchors but not the Tags. This is okay for our use case because (as you can see in the sytem interaction diagram) the Anchors are the ones who send the Raspi the range data, not the Tags. </p>

												<h4>Message Rx/Tx and Connecting the Arduino to the RasPi</h4>										
												<p>This week we worked on sending and receiving messages using the DWM1000s <a href="https://github.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/commit/12cf74a850eb087c78a123c0281444904d19bff8" target="_blank">(code)</a>. This proved to be a very arduous process. Additionally, rather than using the default config, we configured our DWM1000s using values we had picked out ourselves. We chose to do this in the hopes that we could get as much of the configuration done as possible, all at once. </p>
												<p></p>
												<p>Here are some of the configuration choices we made: </p>
												<ul>
													<li>Data rate: 6.8 Mbps</li>
													<li>Preamble length: 128</li>
													<li>PRF: 64 MHz</li>
													<li>Channel: 2</li>
												</ul>
												<p></p>
												<p>We also worked on getting the raspberry pi connected to the Arduino over serial using an FTDI cable <a href="https://github.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/commit/ab058e38b50cc9c417c85f8f3dbaf1afba09fc5b" target="_blank">(code)</a>.</p>

													<li>Setting up Raspberry Pi.</li>
												</ul>

												<p></p>
													<p>Thanks to Spring Break, this is more like two weeks worth of work(ish).</p>
												<h5>The DWM1000s are here!</h5>
													<p>Much to our relief, the DWM1000s finally arrived. This allowed us to start a lot of the work we had been putting off while waiting for them. First, we soldered them and connected them to our breadboarded prototypes (this was a painful process, we are actually looking forward to being able to surface mount solder them to our PCB), then we decided to make initial contact with them by simply reading the device ID from the chip (some read operations are more complex than others due to offsets, etc. and this one seemed like a simple one to start out with). We then moved on to accommodating reads/writes with various address offsets.</p>
												<h5>RasPi and Server Deployment</h5>
													<p>This week we also decided to focus on deploying our web server and attempting to query it from the Raspberry Pi. This activity was good because it forced us to setup the Raspberry Pi and configure the Wifi adapter we bought. Additionally, it forced us to go through the web server deployment process which, even with experience, tends to be a bit tricky. We chose to deploy on Heroku because it is easy and we do not need to store data persistantly in our DB. Below is an example output from our API.</p>

												<h5>Eagle Schematic</h5>
													<p>
														After having a working prototype, we decided it was time to create an Eagle schematic of our prototype so we can be ready to print the PCBs as soon as possible. We are still waiting to confirm a few of the connections (mostly waiting for interrupt related connections coming from the DWM1000s). Creating the schematic brought up some problems related to the initial parts we ordered (and their possible lack of surface mount equivalents). For this reason, we had to do some more research into finding the correct surface mount substitutes for the through hole parts being used in the current prototypes. Additionally, we were able to find a <a href="https://github.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/commit/9ff49f17429d7e04b1f94a3f40483ad6cec65fab" target="_blank">DWM1000 library file</a> for Eagle, which meant we didn't need to create/define this part ourselves.

													<p>Much of this week was spent blocked as we waited for our parts to come in (they aren't even all in yet due to a plethora of errors from wrong part being delivered to credit cards being declined). This has set us back a bit -- especially because the bulk of the parts came in on Thursday but we are still waiting for our most crucuial part: the DWM1000 tranceivers.</p>
												</div>
												<p></p>
												<p> In the face of this setback, we have been reorganizing and focusing on the things we can do without our tranceivers:</p>

												<ul>
													<li>Project structure and build setup for microcontrollers. Including Makefiles that let us link to the Arduino library. <a href="https://github.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/commit/4179eefa6e56ac756bdf30370de4973f89213884" target="_blank">(code)</a></li>
													<li>Our django server. <a href="https://github.com/nshoemaker/LowPowerRangers/commit/7f96ca16664447863ede22a42b2754b77474dc33" target="_blank">(code)</a></li>
													<li>Breadboarding and programming our new 3V Atmega328s.</li>

												<h4>Ultra Wide Band (UWB)</h4>
												<p>UWB radios use time of flight (TOF) analysis to gain distance readings with <b>sub-meter accuracy</b>. Because UWB radios are not yet ubiquitous (not in phones like BLE or WiFi), UWB tracking is often used in custom installations which are expensive. Additionally, the biggest player in the production of UWB transceivers, <a href="http://www.decawave.com/">Decawave</a>, is a closed source shop and charges large amounts to gain access to their <a href="http://www.decawave.com/products/trek1000" >development kits</a>.</p>
