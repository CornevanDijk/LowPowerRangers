The app idea is to make an Android mobile application which can use data it receives from the server to show the most recent position of the tag being tagged. To do this the Android app will connect to the website and pull information and update the locations of the tags on screen.

The main screen will have dots whcih move around representing different tags. A mockup is attached below -

The dot representing the tag will move around as required. The position of the tag is fixed at the top of the screen and the user will have to orient himself that way as there is no way of knowing which direction the user is relative to the anchors.

It will allow the user to add new tags by entering their tag ID and a name for them. A mockup is below -

This menu comes up when the user presses the plus button to add a new tag. The user can then enter a tag ID and the application will check to make sure it exists and if it does, add it to the main screen.
